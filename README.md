# Comparison-of-AES-Triple-DES-and-DES-encryption in c#
This is the comparison of different encryption algorithms using time frame.
If you want to change the keys to encrypt you can change from program.
This is the smooth and simple project that try to encrypt text with three encryption algorithm AES, Triple DES and DES.
And this is a form application.
